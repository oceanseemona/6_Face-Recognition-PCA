## Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis

OBJECTIVE:

• To perform face recognition using Principal Component Analysis on dataset of 40 person which consists of 10 images each and to display the curve between accuracy and k (direction ) while varying the value of k.

DATASET :

• The main folder contains dataset of 40 person, each folder containing 10 images per person.
